# Using Yummy Data to Explore Food in Vector Space!

My friend and I had a funny question (in the days before ChatGPT existed): if we let primitive NLP models cook, what recipes would they make?
We started off with an EDA to look at what recipes look like if we look at it from a vectorized perspective. At the time (early in my university career), I was just starting to learn NLP techniques, so we elected to use a simple bag-of-words approach in our EDA. But even so, the results surprised us!
